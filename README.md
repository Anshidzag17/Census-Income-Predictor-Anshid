# ðŸ§  Income Prediction Using Census Data

Welcome to the **Income Prediction ML Project Assignment**!  

This is a web application that predicts whether a person earns more or less than $50K annually based on features like age, education, capital gain/loss, and marital status. The application uses a trained machine learning model and offers both a Flask-based web interface and a Streamlit interface for interaction.

ðŸ§  Model Description:
Model: A classification model (likely Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.) stored as classification_model.pkl

Scaler: StandardScaler or similar object saved as scaler.pkl

Target: Predict  income
