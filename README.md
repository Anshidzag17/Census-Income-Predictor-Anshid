Welcome to the **Income Prediction ML Project Assignment**!  

This is a web application that predicts whether a person earns more or less than $50K annually based on features like age, education, capital gain/loss, and marital status. The application uses a trained machine learning model and offers both a Flask-based web interface and a Streamlit interface for interaction.

Scaler: StandardScaler or similar object saved as scaler.pkl

Target: Predict if income is >50K or <=50K

ðŸ›  Features:
* Categorical to numerical feature mapping

* Log-transform on age

* Standardization on selected numeric columns

* Manual mapping for education and sex
